# Tooth N Claw

Tooth N Claw XBox widget allows on the fly adjust the APU power and graphics settings mid game.
Windows Fullscreen Experience lacks launchers for Intel Graphics Software, and easy controller based settings toggles.
This improves XBox FSX and gamers don't have to drop off to Desktop mode often to adjust simple APU settings.

## Features
- **CPU Boost Toggle** – Enable or disable CPU Boost to reduce power consumption by up to 50%, freeing power headroom for the GPU.
- **Frame Limiter** – Lock your frame rate for consistent performance and thermals. With VRR displays, optimal values are typically 48–116 FPS.
- **Frame Sync Options** – Choose your preferred frame synchronization mode to balance latency and visual smoothness.
- **Display Resolution Control** – Some Windows games and apps behave unpredictably when changing resolutions dynamically; this tool helps manage those scenarios cleanly.
- **Endurance Gaming (Auto-TDP)** – Intel’s adaptive power management feature that automatically adjusts CPU/GPU power allocation to maintain a target frame rate while extending battery life.
- **Xe Low Latency (XeLL)** – Reduces input latency by intelligently delaying frame presentation for improved responsiveness.
- **Intel Graphics Software Launcher** – Provides quick access to the Intel Graphics Control Center, even when running in Xbox Game Bar full-screen mode.
